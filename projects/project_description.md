## ðŸ“¡ DYNAMICS: Distributed Multi-Modal Sensing Aided Large-Scale MIMO Communications (PI)
**Funder:** Research Council of Finland  
**Joint NSFâ€“RCF Project:** with Prof. Ahmed Alkhateeb, Arizona State University, USA  

Driven by the increasing demand for higher data rates, current and future communication networks rely heavily on large-scale MIMO systems and higher-frequency bands. This poses critical challenges, including high channel acquisition overhead, sensitivity to blockages, and difficulties in user scheduling and association.  

This project develops frameworks that:  
- Optimize environment semantic extraction and data fusion at distributed sensors  
- Account for overheads and benefits of multi-modal sensing  
- Enhance overall network performance and scalability of high-frequency MIMO systems

## ðŸŽ¯ DIRECTION: Deep Unfolding 6G Wireless Communications and Sensing Solutions (PI)
**Funder:** Research Council of Finland  

To realize the rapid growth of data traffic and applications, **THz communications**, **reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)**, and **joint communications and sensing (JCAS/ISAC)** are key enabling technologies. Their potential, however, can only be unlocked with low-complexity, scalable, and practical solutions.  

**DIRECTION** develops **deep unfolding methods** for:  
- Wideband THz transceiver designs  
- Metasurface control  
- JCAS optimization  

The solutions leverage domain knowledge and AI/ML fusion, defining a comprehensive methodology of AI-driven signal processing techniques for 6G.

## ðŸ”— INTEGRATE: Integrated Sensing and Communication with RIS and Machine Learning (PI)
**Funder:** Nokia Donation  
**Collaboration:** Prof. Ping Jack Soh's antenna team, CWC-UOulu  

ISAC is expected to be a cornerstone technology in future wireless networks, but its dual operations create performance trade-offs. RIS provides a promising solution by reshaping the EM environment, and coupling RIS with ML enables efficient, scalable operation.  

**Focus areas:**  
- ML-enabled RIS-assisted ISAC design and optimization  
- Practical demonstrations in the 6â€“15 GHz frequency range (candidate for 6G)  
- Joint algorithmic innovation and hardware prototyping

## âš¡ DECENT: Deep Unfolding Solutions to Energy-Efficient Transceiver Designs in 6G THz Systems (PI)
**Funder:** Nokia Foundation  

**DECENT** develops efficient AI/ML solutions for **hybrid beamforming (HBF) transceivers** in THz communications. The key goals are:  
- Lightweight deep neural network (DNN) architectures for scalable deployment  
- Energy-efficient and distributed solutions for wideband transceivers  
- Replacing iterative algorithms with fast, deep unfolding-based methods  

Our fundamental research ambition is to create **practical, high-performance AI-driven transceiver design frameworks** for sustainable 6G systems.
