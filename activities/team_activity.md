# Group Event – September 18, 2025

On **September 18, 2025**, our group had a wonderful meeting to share experiences on creating **Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)**, followed by an exciting outing at **Koitelinkoski, Oulu**.  

It was inspiring to learn about different **BBQ traditions from around the world** and enjoy them together as a team. 🌍🍖🔥  

A big thanks to the **BBQ committee** – *Sina Tavakolian, Abolfazl Zakeri, and Pouya Mobaraki* – for organizing such a memorable event! 🌿🙌
